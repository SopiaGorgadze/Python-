# nested classes



# The outer class should be called School.
# The nested class should be called Student.
# The Student class should have:
# name and grade as attributes.
# A method greet() that prints a greeting message with the student's name and grade.
# The School class should have a method display_students() that lists all students in the school (you can store them in a list).
# ðŸ§  Bonus (optional):

# Add a method in the School class that prints out the number of students.
