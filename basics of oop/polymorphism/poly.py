# polimorphism 

# polimorphism is a greek word that means to have "many forms or faces"

#           poly = many
#           morphe = form


#           TWO WAYS TO ACHIEVE POLYMORPHISM 
#           1. inheritance - an object could be  treated of the same as a parent class
#           2. "Duck typing" - object must have necessary attributes/methods
